# Description

## A mod that allows you to recycle items back into resources used to make them. Adds a 'Reclaim' tab/button to the crafting menu. Additionally can be used inside of your inventory directly.

`Version checks with itself. If installed on the server, it will kick clients who do not have it installed.`

`This mod uses ServerSync, if installed on the server and all clients, it will sync all configs to client`

`This mod uses a file watcher. If the configuration file is not changed with BepInEx Configuration manager, but changed in the file directly on the server, upon file save, it will sync the changes to all clients.`

All original code for the crafting tab/button was written

## Mod Information
This mod is a combination
of [OdinsInventoryDiscard](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/OdinPlus/OdinsInventoryDiscard/) and the mod above.
The aim is to provide an all in one solution for
recycling items back into resources.

All code changes after the initial release of this mod were written by me. This includes the merging of the two mods and any improvements made to the code.
